# LoginForm
A basic login and registration form. When a correct login occurs,  presents a login success page and displays the username. Redirects the user if trying to access the success page without logging in first. Has some CSS styling on it so it's not murder on the eyes. Needs a URL set-up to implement, have one hosted live on a school server which will close soon. Use command "php filename.php" to check for errors.
