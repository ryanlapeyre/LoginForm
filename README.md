# LoginForm
A basic login and registration form. When a correct login occurs,  presents a login success page and displays the username. Redirects the user if trying to access the success page without logging in first. Has some CSS styling on it so it's not murder on the eyes. Needs a URL set-up to implement, I recommend using an Amazon instance, easy to use and cheap for students. Use command "php filename.php" to check for errors. You will need your own database to implement the login in which store the usernames and passwords, so make sure to create one to use. I did not use a hashing algorithm to store the passwords since the server I was working on had an older version of PHP. I recommend doing so and using sha1.
